# News Aggregator

### Description

For this assignment you have to implement an application that aggregates news from two different APIs. The APIs youâ€™ll be using are Reddit and [News API](https://newsapi.org/). This application should be running on your localhost and serve the result in JSON format from an endpoint whenever it gets a request. You are allowed to use 3rd party wrappers of these APIs.

### Part I

The two functionalities that need to be implemented are â€œlistâ€ and â€œsearchâ€.

This is an example request for a generic GET request.

    > Request
    GET /news   HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ
    Accept: application/json
    
    > Response
    [
      {
        "headline": "Human organs can be stored for three times as long in major breakthrough for transplants",  // Headline of the article
        "link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2019/09/09/human-organs-can-stored-three-times-long-major-breakthrough/",  // Link of the article
        "source": "reddit" // Source that you retrieved this news from
      },
      {
        "headline": "Depth of Field: The Shared Memory of One World Trade Center",
        "link": "https://www.wired.com/story/one-world-trade-center-history-future/",
        "source": "newsapi"
      },
    ]

You should also implement a feature that allows someone to search.

    > Request
    GET /news?query=bitcoin   HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ
    Accept: application/json
    
    > Response
    [
      {
        "headline": "IRS goes after cryptocurrency owners for unpaid taxes",
        "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/own-bitcoin-irs-pursues-cryptocurrency-owners-for-unpaid-taxes/",
        "source": "reddit"
      },
      {
        "headline": "Skirting US sanctions, Cubans flock to cryptocurrency to shop online, send funds",
        "link": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/skirting-us-sanctions--cubans-flock-to-cryptocurrency-to-shop-online--send-funds-11901148",
        "source": "newsapi"
      },
    ]

*Suggestion:* Try to use /r/news for Reddit and the general category for News API (you donâ€™t have to but itâ€™s worth checking out).

You have to at least return the three fields that are in the sample requests above. You can add more fields if youâ€™d like.

### Part II

Store the data from the API into a database such that, if a request is repeated, the response is returned from the database and does not need a new API call.

Again, you must store at least the three fields from Part I and any other fields you decide to store.

You should also set an expiry on this data. If a user makes a request that you have seen in the past, but it is past the expiry limit, you should make a fresh call to the API

Note that you should not store this data in the cache, but rather in the database.

### Constraints

You have to use **Django (version 1.8 - 2.2)** and a **relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)** for this task.

This needs to be a running Python application on your localhost that serves an HTTP request not a console application.

### Submission

You should upload your code to a Github/Bitbucket repository (private or public) and share it with [musab@stellic.com](mailto:musab@stellic.com). Your repository should have a README.md that explains how to run the code and if youâ€™ve done anything extra.

The application that you submit must have thoughtful design decisions, well documented and unit tested code.

You are free to ask questions/clarifications at [musab@stellic.com](mailto:musab@stellic.com). You will ***not*** be penalized for this.

### Assessment

This assignment is meant to test: 

- Proficiency with Python and Django
- Ability to understand and use 3rd party APIs
- Ability to parse different forms of data
- Ability to design an extendible database schema
- Ability to use Version Control
- Ability to write unit tests
- Ability to write documentation

**What we will be looking for:**

- Great code design and architecture that is extendible to more 3rd party news apps or more fields
- Well documented and clean code with unit tests

*Best of luck!*
